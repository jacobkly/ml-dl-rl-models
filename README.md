# ðŸ§  ML / DL / RL Models

Welcome to my personal collection of **Machine Learning (ML)**, **Deep Learning (DL)**, and **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** models. This repository is organized into folders, each representing a different algorithm or architecture I've implemented.

## ðŸ“š Purpose

This project serves as a central hub for models I've built while learning and experimenting with ML, DL, and RL techniques. Itâ€™s a growing collection I maintain to:
- Practice building models from scratch and using libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow)
- Compare performance and behavior across different algorithms
- Serve as reference material for future projects

Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute ideas if you find something interesting here!
